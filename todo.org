- [deduction] try to use the syntax for natural deduction we learned from DIYTT
  to formalize deduction of JoJo Calculus
- [paper] Simply Typed JoJo Calculus
* deduction
- [deduction] specify the syntax
- [deduction] try the deduction syntax on other logic (modal logic)
* sequent
- [sequent] syntax for sequent calculus style deduction
* jojo
- the cut level is stable
  only [x : A] and (- A)
  exe level jo in eval is also simple
  but exe level jo in cut can generate different pattern of cut level jo
- how to handle inductive type in jojo ?
- [adventure] both `(let x)` and `[x]`
- [adventure] syntax for explicit tail call
- [adventure.simple] `type <name> = { ... }`
- [adventure.simple] representing data types
- [adventure.counted] annotation for arg_count and ret_count
- [adventure.counted] infer arg_count and ret_count
- [adventure.counted] eq by eval
- [adventure.counted] encode permutation group
* automath
- jojo is real close to automath
* DIY type theory
- implement proof checker first
  and view type checker as generating proofs
* eopl
- [eopl.lang_module]
- [eopl.lang_class]
- [eopl] note about further reading
* de_bruijn
- [de_bruijn] `let type <name> = ...`
- [de_bruijn] representing data types
- [de_bruijn_logical]
  - view type atom as logic variable and use unification
  - this should be a different language from [de_bruijn]
- [de_bruijn] synth
- theory about equality between lambda terms
  - reflexivity
    symmetry
    transitivity
    congruence
    beta_reduction
    eta_reduction
* miniml
- [miniml] the CAM machine
* the little mler
- as test for some of the languages
* lambda
- church's encoding and the unsolvable problem paper
- can norm-by-eval handle call-by-name terms ?
- what are examples of call-by-value bad terms ?
* curry
- [curry] view type atom as logic variable and use unification
  - type system of curry style need type variable
    there is no version of curry style without type variable
* tartlet
- [tartlet] extend tartlet to pie
- [tartlet] use `TODO` as un-implemented
- [tartlet] block of let and return
- [tartlet] extend tartlet to define new inductive types
  - keep it subrecursive
  - generate data and ind, rec and iter
- [tartlet] add cumulative (maybe non-cumulative) levels of types -- type^n
- [to be sure] why we *do need* "type directed norm-by-eval" here ?
- [to be sure] about the use of TheVal and friends
- [test] eta conversion: f == (x) => f(x)
* the little typer
- as test for dependently typed language
* pure type system
- in addition to a file to eval, also a file of config of sorts, axioms and rules
- logic framework is a special case of pure type system ?
  plus a single subtyping-like rule
  A: Set --> A: Type
  - where `Set` is inductively generate datatype
* sysf
* minitt
- [note] why we *do not need* "type directed norm-by-eval" here ?
- [question] I think the use of NormEnv will break `equals`
- add `eqv_t` `same` `replace`
- add constrains to type constructors
- why not jsut use letrec for every definition ? -- learn from EOPL
- add cumulative (maybe non-cumulative) levels of types -- type_t(n)
- be sure about the use of Pattern
  - write some notes
  - Norm do not use Pattern
  - note about how letrec is handled at lookup-time
* module system
* partech
- [partech] rewrite in c
- [partech] ErrMsg and Span
- [partech] better report with ErrMsg in context
* compile with cps
* sat
- sat solver visualization (how ?)
* complexity
- cook's machine for trans algo to lin-algo
* lambda machine
- new machine for call-by-name or call-by-need lambda
* term rewriting
* dsl
